## About

This is the source code for my website portfolio.

I built this website using the following tools:

- Laravel
- Vue.js
- Inertia.js
- SASS

## Design Conception

I wanted to go for a simplistic but professional look for my website. I spent a few days browsing professional portfolios for inspiration.

## Changes for the future

- I like the design for desktop and mobile displays, however, the design could be improved for tablet devices as the text feels a bit too stretched and there is too much whitespace.
- I'd like to add a light theme for better accessibility.
