        <p>
            My name is Aaron. I love building websites and learning new tricks
            and tools that can help develop my skills as a web artisan. I'm a
            dad of two beautiful little girls who inspire me to achieve my goals
            and make my mark as a professional web developer.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm passionate about delivering the best quality code that I can.
            I'm a reflective person and try looking at my work from the
            perspectives of an artist and a consumer. I enjoy using frameworks
            like Laravel and Vue.js, as they help me to structure my thinking
            into logical boxes.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have working experience with Laravel, PHP, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap,
            JavaScript, SQL, and Git/GitHub.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I am learning Inertia.js and Vue.js frameworks to improve
            my front-end capabilities.
