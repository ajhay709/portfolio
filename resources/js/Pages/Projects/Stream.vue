        <h3>Setting the scene</h3>
        <p>
            Stream is an ongoing collaboration between one of my close friends
            and myself. We built a mock cinema booking system at the university
            for our honors project. My friend refactored the code into a PHP
            website that mimics services like Netflix to practice our technical
            abilities and design using little to no frameworks or libraries.
        </p>

        <h3>The problem</h3>
        <p>
            We built the original website using the lessons and methodologies
            taught in college and university. We have learned better practices
            from our work experiences and want to upgrade the site to reflect
            this. However, as mentioned, the constraints are to build the new
            website with "vanilla" PHP, CSS, and JavaScript.
        </p>

        <h3>The solution</h3>
        <p>
            I will upgrade the website front-end, creating reusable components
            and implementing modern design considerations. These include
            responsiveness, correct usage of typography and tone, and
            accessibility. I will be implementing routing and middleware
            functionality to reflect the features seen in modern web frameworks.
